# Stanford CAPx
#### Version 8.x-1.0-dev

CAPx allows users to pull data from cap.stanford.edu in to a Drupal entity.

## What is CAP?

CAP Network is a virtual workspace, originally created by the School of Medicine, to support collaboration among faculty, graduate students, postdocs and staff. In 2013, it was expanded in partnership with various Schools, Institutes, and administrative offices to create the Stanford Profiles website.

Combining a profile directory with a social networking backend, CAP makes it easy for you to work closely with colleagues and track the projects that matter most to youâ€”all in a private, secure environment

### Security
#### HTTPS
CAPx uses https for all API calls. Please follow this best practice as you develop with this module.
#### httpoxy mitigation:
In July 2016, the httpoxy security exploit was announced for PHP, including libraries such as Guzzle. CAPx installs were by default protected because of https usage (see above). In addition, **developers are encouraged to seek their own httpoxy mitigation steps at the server level**. Check with your hosting provider to ensure that your implementation is protected from httpoxy. See https://httpoxy.org for details.
